## 👋 Hey, I'm Pada

I'm a **Computer Science graduate** who's been coding for over **5 years** — and honestly, I’ve never stopped learning since I wrote my first line of code.  
I enjoy working with **modern tech stacks** because I’ve never been a fan of doing things “the old way.”  
I love exploring fresh tools, frameworks, and ideas that make development faster, cleaner, and more fun.

I build projects that connect ideas to real-world impact — whether it’s designing smooth frontend experiences, creating robust backend systems, or experimenting with AI-driven features.
